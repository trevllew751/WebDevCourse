Object Oriented Programming

Prototypes
    Umbrella object for all instances of a certain data type
    Prototype for Arrays, Strings, Objects, etc
    Can be modified but not recommended

Factory Functions
    Function that creates an object with methods and variables from the arguments passed then returns that object

Constructor Functions
    "new" keyword
    Define methods on the prototype rather than on the individual objects

Classes
    Syntactic sugar
    Does the same thing as factory functions or constructor functions but it is easier to read and cleaner to write
    "super" and "extends" keyword
