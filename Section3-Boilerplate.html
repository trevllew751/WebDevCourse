    <h1>Computer</h1> <! should only have a single h1 on a page>
    <p>
        A <b>computer</b> is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
        automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of
        operations,
        called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete"
        computer
        including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for
        "full"
        operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that
        are
        connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

        Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes
        simple
        special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and
        computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as
        smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their
        users.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of the word "computer" was in 1613 in a book
        called
        The Yong Mans Gleanings by English writer Richard Braithwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of Times,
        and
        the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." This usage of
        the
        term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued
        with
        the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of this period women were often
        hired
        as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.[1] By 1943, most human computers were
        women.[2]

        The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of "computer" in the 1640s, meaning "one who
        calculates"; this is an "agent noun from compute (v.)". The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the use of
        the
        term to mean "'calculating machine' (of any type) is from 1897." The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates that
        the
        "modern use" of the term, to mean "programmable digital electronic computer" dates from "1945 under this name;
        [in
        a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as Turing machine".[3]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with
        fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout
        the
        Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably
        livestock
        or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[4][5] The use of counting rods is one example.
